   * Method called by {@linkplain DatabaseManager#deregisterDatabase(Database) } to notify the

   * The {@code deregister} method is intended only to be used by database and not by applications.
   * Databases are recommended to not implement {@code DatabaseAction} in a public class. If there
   * are active connections to the database at the time that the {@code deregister} method is
   * called, it is implementation specific as to whether the connections are closed or allowed to
   * continue. Once this method is called, it is implementation specific as to whether the database
   * may limit the ability to open collections of a database, invoke other {@code Database} methods
   * or throw a {@code XMLDBException}. Consult your database's documentation for additional
   * information on its behavior.
