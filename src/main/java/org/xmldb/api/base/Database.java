 * The interface that every XMLDB base class must implement.

 * The {@code DatabaseManager} allows for multiple databases.
 *
 * <P>
 * Each XMLDB should supply a class that implements the {@linkplain Database} interface.
 *
 * <P>
 * The {@code DatabaseManager} will try to load as many drivers as it can find and then for any
 * given {@code Database} request, it will ask each {@code Database} in turn to try to connect to
 * the target URI.
 *
 * <P>
 * It is strongly recommended that each {@code Database} class should be small and standalone so
 * that the {@code Database} class can be loaded and queried without bringing in vast quantities of
 * supporting code.
 *
 * <P>
 * When a {@code Database} class is loaded, it should create an instance of itself and register it
 * with the {@code DatabaseManager}. This means that a user can load and register a driver by
 * calling:
 * <p>
 * {@code Class.forName("foo.bah.Database")}
 * <p>
 * A {@code Database} may create a {@linkplain DatabaseAction} implementation in order to receive
 * notifications when {@linkplain org.xmldb.api.DatabaseManager#deregisterDatabase} has been called.
